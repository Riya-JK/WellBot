 WellBot: An NLP-powered Health-care and Mental Health Support Chatbot.

Mental health plays a crucial role in our overall well-being, affecting our emotions, thoughts, and behaviors. It is essential for effectively managing stress, building relationships, and adapting to life's difficulties. Despite the prevalence of mental health issues, recovery and support are possible.

To promote understanding and awareness, a dataset of frequently asked questions (FAQs) about mental health has been compiled. This dataset offers valuable insights into common inquiries, concerns, and curiosities surrounding mental health. By analyzing and leveraging this dataset, individuals, professionals, and researchers can deepen their understanding, disseminate information, and contribute to the well-being of those facing mental health challenges.

In this code, after training the intent prediction model, we implement a simple chatbot interaction loop. The chatbot asks the user for input, predicts the intent using the trained model, and generates a response based on the predicted intent. The example responses provided are placeholders and should be replaced with appropriate responses based on your specific use case and dataset.

You can further enhance the chatbot by integrating it with a more sophisticated framework or implementing additional functionalities, such as entity recognition or sentiment analysis. The code provided serves as a starting point for deploying the intent prediction model in a chatbot environment.
